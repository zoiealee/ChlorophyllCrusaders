We are starting with a random walk model to examine the temporal behavior of GCC at Harvard Forest. 
In our data model, we observe the Green Chomatic Coordinate(GCC) data and how it relates to the to the latent variable representing the true underlying GCC. 
In our process model, we describe the evolution of the latent variable representing GCC over time. We use a random walk process, and we assumed that the latent variable at each time point follows a normal distribution with mean equal to the GCC at the previous time point and precision (tau_add) as a parameter.

We chose the priors from iteratively testing the model, our priors are the initial condition, observation error and the process error. 

Overall, this Bayesian model integrates observed GCC data with prior beliefs about the initial condition, observation error, and process error to infer the behavior of GCC over time, employing a random walk process.
